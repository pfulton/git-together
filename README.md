# Git Together

Let's play with and learn Git together with this repo!

Git is sometimes difficult to understand, especially if you're not in a team setting. So, let's use this repository to play around with Git and learn by doing!

You really can't do anything "wrong". Clone it, change files, change parts of files, delete files, add files, rename files, whatever! Hopefully, we'll all learn something by playing with this project.

It's probably best to start here: [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
